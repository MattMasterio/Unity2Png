
Rendered Textures in this folder are used as 'settings containers' and are not used by any camera.
Properties are copied to create temporary textures with the same format.

# Linear / Gamma color formats:
	If you are using 'Linear' color space in the project then you should use 'U2P_Linear_...' file in Unity2PNG.
	If you are using 'Gamma' color space in the project then you should use 'U2P_Gamma_...' file in Unity2PNG.

# File name patterns (you can name it as you wish, naming like this helps switch between presets or use another preset for each Unity2PNG instance):
	
	'U2P_' + <ColorSpace> + '_' + <ColorFormat> + '_' + <Size>'

	Example: 
		'U2P_Gamma_R32G32B32A32_SFLOAT_512x512'	(captures HDR)
		'U2P_Gamma_R8G8B8A8_UNORM_512x512'	(NOT captures HDR)
		'U2P_Linear_R8G8B8A8_SRGB_512x512'

# HDR
	To capture HDR you should check a ColorFormat property in RenderedTexture component.
	For example: If your project uses 'Gamma' color space then you should use a 'U2P_Gamma_R32G32B32A32_SFLOAT_...'.
	ColorFormat 'R32G32B32A32_SFLOAT' can handle HDR in this scenario.

	It depends from system you work on and is hard to tell which option is the best for your project.
	To find the best solution just capture HDR object in all 'ColorFormats' (ColorFormat can be changed at RendererTexture settings).
